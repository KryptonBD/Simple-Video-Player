# Simple Video Player
 Been Working on a project for online learning where I need to make custom video player. So decided to do it on vanilla and here we are.
 
 Video Player using HTML5, CSS, JS and Fontawesome heavily inspired by Wes Bos.
 
 What's new here are
 
 -workes in Full Screen, 
 
 -different control
 
 -not emojis but icons from fontawesome
